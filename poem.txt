There I Stand
by Anthony Petralito

Within the restlessness of humanity
A tapestry of noise
A compilation of complexity
There I stand in poise

I close my eyes and fade away
To somewhere very new
Or perhaps a place of fantasies
To that same, special hue

The wind whistles upon entry
Making forest trees speak
There I stand silent
With snow tears down my cheek

I feel a poking on my shoulder though
So its time to say goodbye
To that special place of silence
Which is withered through time
